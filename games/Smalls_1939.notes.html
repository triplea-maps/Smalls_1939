 This is smallman's mod for the bigworld 1942 map.  Was edited from Nekahnet's 1939, with a focus on improving balance for both dice and LL, and promoting  strategy variety. <br> <br> Also credit to Prussia for adding flags to the capitals, Maimed for his playtesting and feedback, Veqryn for his technical assistance in having map up to date,  and all the many players who helped playtest the map over the years. <br> <br> The game notes below have been kept from previous versions and might not be as relevant as they once were. <br>  <br>   This is a Triple-A variant of 1939 Pact of Steel Big World. It's a revision of the so called 'historical' game, (which is neither historical, nor 1939) Hill's old <br> Advanced fixed lame armour stats, carrier price, and channel access. <br> One big difference in this version is that industrial production  centers now generate far more PUs as do strategically important zone <br> like Egypt's canal zone (6 PUs), Gibraltar(3 PUs), Sicily (4 PUs)  and the oil fields of Rumania (7 PUs) and Saudi Arabia (7 PUs).<br> <br> To lessen the impact of this economic generation, the price of  factories is 25 PUs. (though it might arguably make sense to boost <br> that to 35 PUs). (if only there were a way to have separate resource  (BRPs) and production (PUs) values for each territory! )<br> <br> 1)The game generally strengthens neutrals and makes zones like  Turkey, Spain and Allied France more historically realistic. Hungary/ <br> Rumania/Finland/Greece and other neutrals have challenging militaries  and bigger resource (PU) holdings. Axis (and Soviet) military set <br> backs are now a possibility for poorly executed or just plain unlucky  invasions.<br> <br> 2) The game generally makes Britain's hold on North Africa (Egypt)  more economically critical and tenuous as was the case in the real <br> war. Places like Sicily are bumped up because of their strategic  important in threatening this hold.<br> <br> 3) The U.S. is far more powerful at the offset economically than any  other version I know, and sees that power snowball quickly leaving <br> the axis a pronounced window to rapidly grow its resource strength  against Russia, England and european neutrals. The U.S. now has to <br> work if it wants to control South America, but there is no need  because of its vast mainland PU reserve.<br> <br> 4) Italy is generally stronger, but balanced. Italy had the fourth  largest fleet in WWII, bigger than the German surface fleet by far. <br> And Italy's poor military showing in the real war doesn't discount  its strategic impact in tying down allied forces and supporting <br> Germany's push into southeastern Europe and Africa. However, her bark  remains bigger than her bite unless she or Germany can land a lucky <br> strike against Egypt or Gibraltar. And rash early invasion of Greece  or Southern France can potentially now cost Italy the game. Italy now <br> has enough transports to launch the Afrika Korps. and keeps its  historical outpost in Ethiopia, threatening the south of the Suez <br> Canal zone.<br> <br> 5) Russia is also stronger, which gets rid of the illusion that  England might have defeated Russia's vast armies alone, which of <br> course, isn't true. Russia starts off on roughly equal economic/  resource footing with Germany and can hold pace until the Axis <br> overruns Western Europe. It also starts with a fragile armoured  presence in the Far East. Russia has a small Northern and Black Sea <br> Fleet for defense and possible counterstrike against an axis mistake. <br> 6) Japan is weakened somewhat in relative terms. Japan's industrial  capacity was not as overwhelming as some versions of Triple-A games <br> would make it seem. (I've seen a few where Japan takes Moscow! That's  less likely due to a stronger Russian start in the Far East and U.S. <br> Flying Tiger in China).<br> <br> 7) Britain is about the same strength. But an effort was made to show  her dependency on overseas outposts like India, Australia, Canada and <br> Africa which are highly vulnerable to the Axis and Japan. The United  Kingdom's Island's defenses hung by a threat and were far weaker than <br> let's say France's mainland forces that were beaten by Germany in  1940. Eastern Canada, Southern Africa, India Egypt and Australia are <br> critical to a U.K. victory....<br> <br> 8) Germany is now much more resilient with vast PU production in  East and West Germany. But unless Germany can expand rapidly, it will <br> face Russian forces of roughly equal capabilities, which was the case  historically. Late game axis minor contributions from Hungary, <br> Finland, and Rumania are represented by generally higher PUs, though  forces in these countries must still be defeated. (otherwise Russia <br> could grab them too easily). U Boat numbers are slightly upped to  pose a real threat in the Atlantic.<br> <br> 9) China is largely unchanged. However Kansu is now stronger and has  a U.S. Flying Tiger fighter airwings that may delay a rush by <br> Japanese forces.<br> <br> 10) More PUs mean more possibilities, but possibly more imbalances  in playing.
